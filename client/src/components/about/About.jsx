        I am a highly skilled full stack web developer with a unique background that sets me apart from others in my field. I have a degree in Music Theory which has taught me the value of discipline, creativity, and attention to detail. I have also spent 25 years in retail, giving me a strong understanding of customer service and the ability to work well under pressure. In my personal time, I enjoy indulging my passions of gaming, cooking and astronomy. My love for exploring new recipes and experimenting with different ingredients has given me a strong attention to detail and a love for problem-solving. The combination of my education, work experience, and personal interests make me a well-rounded individual with a strong skill set. In the past decade, I have been primarily focused on full-time parenting, where I have honed my ability to multitask and work efficiently while also prioritizing family life. I am excited to bring these skills and qualities to my work as a full stack web developer.
